## Challenge 11: NoteTaker

## Description:
This project focuses on creating APIs and implementing modularization to manage tasks effectively. The goal is to design a system that uses APIs to organize tasks efficiently, improving scalability and maintainability through modularized code.

## Motivation:
The motivation behind this project was to improve my understanding of API development and modular programming. By dividing the system into modules, it becomes easier to manage, update, and scale over time.

## Purpose:
The primary purpose is to automate task management by creating APIs, allowing tasks to be created, updated, and deleted efficiently. Modularization enhances code organization and ensures that the system can grow with minimal refactoring.

## Problem Solved:
This project replaces the manual process of writing tasks on paper with a streamlined, digital system. It offers a more efficient way to track tasks and manage them programmatically.

## Lessons Learned:
Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in developing APIs and using modularization techniques to structure code in a way that improves both readability and scalability.
